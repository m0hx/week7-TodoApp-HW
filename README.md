# Spring Security Login

username: user
password: generated in console. (Using generated security password: 06e15cb7-d06f-4ce1-8acb-5d0d57e2a7c1)


# What went right.
All apis are working correctly in postman as expected.

# Challenges you faced.
Some dependencies were missing and the Security dependnecy when I added from https://start.spring.io/ made login/logout automatically.
Also some typos made some errors but I fixed them.

# Which part you enjoyed working on the most.
Testing APIs
